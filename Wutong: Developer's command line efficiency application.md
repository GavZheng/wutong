# Why Wutong is Needed
As stated in **Wutong**'s [README document](https://github.com/GavZheng/wutong/blob/main/README.md), data encoding and conversion are among the frequent tasks developers encounter during development. For example, converting strings to Base64 encoding for network transmission or converting numbers to binary formats for low-level operations. These tasks, while simple, are scattered throughout the development workflow, adding unnecessary burdens to developers.

Traditionally, developers need to leave their familiar development environments and search for specialized tools or websites to complete these tasks. This involves switching between multiple applications, performing complex interactions, and manually copying results back to their development environments. This process is not only time-consuming but, more importantly, the frequent context switching disrupts developers' focus, leading to loss of concentration and inspiration. Such interruptions significantly impact productivity, especially during intensive coding sessions.

To address this issue, developers need a tool that can perform these tasks directly within the terminal environment, reducing context switching and maintaining workflow continuity. [**Wutong**](https://github.com/GavZheng/wutong) was born out of this need. Written in **Rust**, **Wutong** is **small** in memory footprint and **fast** in execution speed. It provides an integrated **command-line tool** that embeds common functionalities like data encoding and conversion directly into the terminal. With its simplicity and speed, **Wutong** helps developers complete tasks quickly while avoiding efficiency losses and focus fragmentation caused by frequent tool switching.

# How Wutong Solves This Problem
As a developer, I designed **Wutong** with a philosophy centered on focus, efficiency, and integration. As mentioned in [**Wutong's Contribution Guide**](https://github.com/GavZheng/wutong/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), **Wutong** aims to create a **seamless**, **efficient**, and **integrated** development environment, allowing developers to focus more on the code itself and create outstanding software products.

To demonstrate why this claim holds, consider the following scenario:  
If you need to generate an MD5 hash for a piece of text, traditionally, you would:
1. Leave your IDE,
2. Open a browser,
3. Search for "MD5,"
4. Browse and select a website from the results,
5. Copy the text into the website to get the result.

This takes five steps! Your focus would shift at least five times over 30 seconds or more. By the time you return to your IDE, can you still maintain your original train of thought? Worse, if the website doesnâ€™t meet your needs, you might have to backtrack, search again, and repeat the process.

With **Wutong**, you only need one step: type a command and press Enter.

For example, to get the MD5 hash of "wutong," simply run:
```bash
wutong md5 wutong
```  
**Wutong** will output the result directly in the terminal.

This is just an example for generating an MD5 hash. What if you need to merge a branch or create a new branch following Gitflow conventions? That could take even more time for research and experimentation, possibly leading to unexpected issues.

With **Wutong**, creating a `feature/wutong` branch is as simple as:
```bash
wutong flow -f wutong
```  

# Explore Wutong
You can find **Wutong** on its GitHub repository: [https://github.com/GavZheng/wutong](https://github.com/GavZheng/wutong). **We desperately need** your Star ðŸŒŸ. Your support not only boosts my confidence and motivation as the author but also determines whether **Wutong** can be published on more platforms. Currently, **Wutong** cannot be added to Homebrew due to insufficient Stars.

# Join Wutong
Unfortunately, **Wutong** currently has only one memberâ€”me. As stated in [**Wutong's README**](https://github.com/GavZheng/wutong/blob/main/README.md), I warmly welcome and highly encourage developers worldwide to join and contribute to **Wutong**'s development. In my vision, the **Wutong** community will use English as its primary language, with documentation supporting multiple languages.
